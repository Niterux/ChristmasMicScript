# ChristmasMicScript
### Dependencies

NodeJS

npm rcon-srcds

npm fast-xml-parser

npm html-entities

VLC Media Player

Use VB-CABLE to pipe audio to TF2

Demo support must be enabled for all servers in TF2

VLC must have its web interface enabled

Please configure all paths and launch options in the script file

Please remove any TF2 mods you have that may overwrite con_logfile (Some huds may do this, mastercomfig does not do this)

I have used Mp3tag to set artist and title metadata
