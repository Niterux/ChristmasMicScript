# ChristmasMicScript
### Dependencies

- Deno

- VLC Media Player

- Team Fortress 2

- npm rcon-srcds

- npm fast-xml-parser

- npm html-entities

### Instruction

- the deno install command should install the npm dependencies I think

- Use VB-CABLE to pipe audio to TF2

- Demo support must be enabled for all servers in TF2

- VLC must have its web interface enabled

- Please configure all paths and launch options in the script file

- Please remove any TF2 mods you have that may overwrite con_logfile (Some huds may do this, mastercomfig does not do this)

- I have used Mp3tag to set artist and title metadata

- I recommend using VLC's built in filters to apply range compression to the audio, low audio volumes sound very bad with Steam's voice

### Binds
- VLCPAUSE
- VLCNEXT
- VLCPLAY
